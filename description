We will be dealing with some simple string manipulation in this challenge. 

Say you are giving a word where all its letters are downcase. Choose a letter from that word and capitalize it, then return the word with the capitalized letter. 

For example, if you are given the word “edition” and the chosen letter is “d”, the returned word should be “eDition”. 

If the chosen letter is “i”, we will capitalize the first time the letter appears, 

The returned word should be “edItion”. 

In manipulate.rb, write a method called manipulate that takes in two arguments: string and letter. The argument letter should be a letter of the given string. Then write code to manipulate the string as described above. 

For example 
p manipulate("hello", "e") 

The output is 
"hEllo" 

Use methods such as index, [], upcase or capitalize for this challenge. DO NOT use gsub or slice here. 

We would like you to get used to the index and [] methods first. There will be other challenges later on where you can use gsub and slice :)
